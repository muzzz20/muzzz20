## About Me

As an international student from Indonesia, my journey into computer science was sparked by a lifelong interest for gaming. I've always been captivated by how code and creativity merge to create immersive digital worlds. I see games as the ultimate art form—blending storytelling, visual art, music, and technology.   
And now, pursuing a major in Graphics and Multimedia Software is my way of turning my gaming passion into professional expertise—learning to build the very experiences that first inspired me.

**Quick note:** You'll see my full name as Ahmad Muzhaffar in official contexts, but actually I go by **Farry** in daily life. But to make things not more complicated, feel free to just call me Ahmad or Muzhaffar. It's a lot easier for everyone, I guess :) (I also don't know why I'm named like this; just ask my parents plz)
